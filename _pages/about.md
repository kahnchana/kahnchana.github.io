* I currently work at VeracityAI building better computer vision algorithms for 
detecting parts and damages in vehicles in order to augment the insurance claims 
process. 
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree from University of Moratuwa in 2020, where I 
completed my thesis on Multi-Object Tracking and PGM based Panoptic Segmentation 
under the supervision of Dr. Ranga Rodrigo and Dr Sadeep Jayasumana.
* I completed my internship at FiveAI, UK supporting their research efforts to 
building better self-driving cars under the supervision of Dr Sadeep Jayasumana, 
Dr Vibhav Vineet, and Dr Sina Samangooei. 
* I am interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning; especially on the 
subdomains of Few Shot Learning, Self-Supervised Learning, and Interpretable 
Representation Learning.
