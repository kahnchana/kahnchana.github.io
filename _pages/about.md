* I currently work at VeracityAI building better computer vision algorithms for 
detecting parts and damages in vehicles in order to augment the insurance claims 
process.  
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree from [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk) in 
2020, where I completed my

on Multi-Object Tracking and PGM based Panoptic Segmentation under the supervision of 
[Dr. Ranga Rodrigo](http://ranga.staff.uom.lk) and [Dr Sadeep Jayasumana](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sadeep/).
* I completed my internship at [FiveAI](https://five.ai), UK supporting their research efforts to 
building better self-driving cars under the supervision of [Dr Sadeep Jayasumana](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sadeep/), 
[Dr Vibhav Vineet](http://vibhavvineet.info), and 
[Dr Sina Samangooei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bOfKAGQAAAAJ&hl=en). 
* I am interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning; especially on the 
subdomains of Few Shot Learning, Self-Supervised Learning, and Interpretable 
Representation Learning. 
* I enjoy poetry, dancing, and debating during my leisure time.
