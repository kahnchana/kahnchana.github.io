* I currently work at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) as a research assistant working in the computer vision department
under the supervision of [Dr Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/).
* I previously worked for [WENN](http://wenn.no) and [VeracityAI](http://veracityai.com/) researching and building 
computer vision algorithms aimed at augmenting vehicle insurance claims processing.
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree from [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk) in 
2020, where I completed my 
<a href="https://github.com/kahnchana/fyp_report/blob/master/main/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a>
on Multi-Object Tracking and PGM based Panoptic Segmentation under the supervision of 
[Dr. Ranga Rodrigo](http://ranga.staff.uom.lk) and [Dr Sadeep Jayasumana](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sadeep/).
* I completed a research internship at [FiveAI](https://five.ai), UK supporting their research efforts to 
building better self-driving cars under the supervision of [Dr Sadeep Jayasumana](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sadeep/), 
[Dr Vibhav Vineet](http://vibhavvineet.info), and 
[Dr Sina Samangooei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bOfKAGQAAAAJ&hl=en). 
* I am interested in **Computer Vision and Machine Learning** with focus on the 
subdomains of Few Shot Learning, Self-Supervised Learning, and Interpretable 
Representation Learning. 
* I enjoy poetry, dancing, and theatre during my leisure time.
